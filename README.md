# Image-Steganography-B.Tech-Project
Image Steganography using Huffman Encoding and Laguerre Transform
In this project, we used the Laguerre Transform, Huffman Encoding, and LSB to achieve image steganography. Several test photos from the USC-SIPI Database have been used. You will need MATLAB for PC with the computational toolbox installed in order to run this project.
